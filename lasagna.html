        <li>2 tablespoons of white sugar</li>
        <li>1.5 cups of milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of melted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans of canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cans of tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup of water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of fennel seeds</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>450g of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>350g of sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic on stove top with medium heat until brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in all crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
            basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Cover dish and simmer for about 1.5 hours,
            stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for
            8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees C.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
            lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.
            Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil:
            to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Allow to cool before eating.</li>
    </ol>
